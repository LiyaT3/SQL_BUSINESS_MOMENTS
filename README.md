# SQL_BUSINESS_MOMENTS
FINDING OUT THE BUSINESS MOMENTS OF A DATA USING SQL

# Machine Failures Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of machine failures using SQL, aimed at achieving the following objectives:

- Minimizing machine failures.
- Maximizing machine reliability.
- Minimizing maintenance costs.

## Constraints

The analysis takes into consideration the following constraints:

- Extreme environmental conditions.
- Outdated machinery.

## Tools Used

- MySQL

## Dataset

- Number of Columns: 14
- Dimensions: 10,000 rows x 14 columns

## SQL Queries and Business Metrics

In this repository, you will find SQL queries and calculations that were performed on the dataset to achieve the objectives stated above. Some of the key business metrics calculated include:

- Failure rate analysis.
- Reliability calculations.
- Maintenance cost optimization.

Please refer to the SQL files in the repository for the details of the queries and calculations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a MySQL database and import the dataset.
3. Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to perform the analysis.
4. Explore the results and use the insights to make informed decisions regarding machine failures, reliability, and maintenance costs.

just say that i calc all 4 business moments

ChatGPT
Certainly, you can add a section to your README to indicate that you've calculated all four business moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) for your dataset. Here's an updated version of the README with that information:
